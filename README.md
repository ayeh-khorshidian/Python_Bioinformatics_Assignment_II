# Python Bioinformatics Assignment II

This repository contains solutions for Python programming tasks focused on conditional statements, loops, lists, and user input validation. The tasks are designed to strengthen fundamental Python skills for bioinformatics applications.

## Task Overview

### Task 1: Object Weight Calculation
A program that calculates the weight of an object based on its mass and provides feedback on whether the object is too heavy, too light, or just right.

### Task 2: Input Validation
A program that ensures the user enters a number between 1 and 100.

### Task 3: Bug Collection for 7 Days
A program that records the number of bugs collected each day for seven days and displays the total.

### Task 4: Creating and Printing a List
A program that creates a list of amino acids and displays the list twice: once as a whole and once element by element.

### Task 5: List Manipulations
A program that modifies the amino acids list by adding, sorting, reversing, and slicing it.

### Task 6: List Indexing with User Input
A program that retrieves an amino acid from a list based on a user-provided index, with error handling for invalid inputs.

## Usage

Run `Bioinformatics_Assignment.py` in a Python environment, following prompts for user inputs where applicable. Each task is separated with comments for clarity.
